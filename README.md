# VanillaJs_To_Do_List
This is a to do list app made purely using JavaSript.

User can add, mark as done and delete list of items.

Local Storage is used to persist the data when the user refreshes the page or closes the browser window/tab.

I have also included a sample image of the App SampleImageOfTheAPP.png in the root.
